# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-_Sorting

1. Open PyCharm or any other Python editior or command promt to run the python code. 
	(This project is developed in pycharm editor)

2. Open the file SortingAlgorithmsComparisionAnalysis.py and run the code.

3. After running the SortingAlgorithmsComparisionAnalysis.py code, it takes a minimum of 2 hours in windows as the input size is of 
	[0,1000,2000,4000,5000,10000,20000,40000,50000,60000,80000,100000]

4. As the input size is long it takes longer time. The run time can be reduced by changing the input size in the code.
	(we could have given the array of input size as a input from the user, but we didn't do that because it was not mentioned in the requirement)

5. Once the execution reaches to the final state, a new window pops-up showing the graph of random generated numbers array, algorithm comparison.

6. This doesn't mean that the execution is completed(please do not terminated the program) instead close the window for the next results of 
	random generated numbers array sorted graph and 
	random generated numbers array sorted reverse graph

7. In the terminal we can observe the random generated array for each size and followed by the time taken for each sorting algorithm at each size respectively.
